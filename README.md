Exploring APIs

 

Objective:  

Apply the knowledge gained from the lesson on "Fetching Data from APIs" to create a practical project that demonstrates understanding of API concepts and implementation.

 

Task Description:  

You are required to develop a simple web application that fetches data from a public API and displays it to the user. The application should incorporate the following subtopics covered in the lesson:

 

Making API Requests
Handling API Responses
Consuming RESTful APIs
JSON Parsing
 

Instructions:

Choose a public API: Research and select a public API that provides data relevant to your interests or a specific topic of your choice. Some examples include weather APIs, news APIs, or movie databases.
Public API ListLinks to an external site.
brunoLinks to an external site.
Set up your development environment: Use any web development tools or frameworks of your choice (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue.js) to create the frontend of your web application.
Make API requests: Use JavaScript's fetch API or any library/framework (e.g., axios) to make HTTP requests to the chosen API endpoints. Ensure proper error handling for failed requests.
Handle API responses: Parse the JSON data returned by the API responses and extract relevant information needed for your application.
Display data to the user: Present the fetched data dynamically on your web application's user interface. This could include displaying lists, images, or any other relevant content.
Test your application: Thoroughly test your application to ensure that it functions as expected. Verify that data is fetched correctly and displayed accurately to the user.
Documentation: Provide documentation for your application, including instructions on how to run the code and any additional details about the API used and its endpoints.
 

Submission Guidelines:

- Submit your assignment as a zip file containing all necessary files, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other assets used in your project.

- Include a README.md file detailing the purpose of your application, the API used, and any additional information required to run the project.

 

Evaluation Criteria:

- Successful retrieval and display of data from the chosen API.

- Effective handling of API responses and errors.

- User-friendly interface and presentation of data.

- Code organization, readability, and adherence to best practices.

- Documentation completeness and clarity.

 

!NOW TEST!
(Retrieving Weather Information from OpenWeatherMap API)

 

Objective:  

To verify that the web application successfully retrieves weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it to the user.

 

Test Steps:

Launch Application:
   - Open the web application in a browser.

Input Location:
   - In the provided input field or dropdown menu, enter a valid location (e.g., city name, ZIP code) for which you want to retrieve weather information.

Submit Request:
   - Click on the "Submit" button or trigger the event to initiate the API request.

Verify API Request:
   - Check that the application sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API endpoint with the specified location as a parameter.

Receive API Response:
   - Confirm that the application receives a valid response from the API, containing weather data for the specified location.

Parse API Response:
   - Ensure that the application correctly parses the JSON response from the API and extracts relevant weather information, such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

Display Weather Information:
   - Verify that the retrieved weather information is displayed accurately on the web page's user interface.

   - Check that the temperature, humidity, and weather condition icons or descriptions are visible and correctly represented.

Test Error Handling:
   - Test scenarios where the API request fails due to reasons such as network issues, invalid location, or API rate limiting.

   - Ensure that the application gracefully handles such errors and provides appropriate error messages or fallback behavior to the user.

Test Multiple Locations:
   - Repeat the above steps for multiple locations to validate that the application can retrieve and display weather information for different locations.

 

Expected Results:

- The application successfully retrieves weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API for the specified location.

- The weather data is accurately parsed and displayed on the web page's user interface.

- Error handling mechanisms effectively handle API request failures and provide meaningful feedback to the user.

- The application maintains functionality and performance when tested with multiple locations.
